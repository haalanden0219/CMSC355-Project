# CMSC 355 Project - Warehouse Database

## Description
This is a warehouse storage program that lets a user search through a data base to find a specific item. We are currently working on the project and have plans on adding more user cases. So far we implemented the search and add use cases. In the subsections below we go into more detail about what we worked on and the requirements for each sprint.

### Testing
- Test 1: This test will use the add use case to check the procedure of adding an item to the warehouse.
- Test 2: This test will use the search use case to check the procedure of looking for an item in the warehouse.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Python Installed
- Tkinter Python Library

### Installing
- Check to make sure python is installed
- Download imported libraries if not already installed

### Executing Program
 - Run ```python gui.py``` to run the gui version of the program
 - Run ```python Test.py``` to run the individual test cases without the gui.
 


# Workflow/Sprint Schedule (Requirements)
## Sprint 1 (due 3/28)

### Overview
The location class has an array that holds type items. The user than creates an item with a name, unique id, quantity and weight. When the user add the items it gets added to predefined location. The user can add multiple items into the location.

### Summary
The first sprint had us meet as a team to create a program and think about the different use cases we needed to implement. We were required to create 2 use cases as well as test cases to show that they work. We were required to hold team meetings to discuss how we wanted to split up the work. We decided to use a Gui design to help the program be much easier to use for non technical users. The first goal was to assign everyone different tasks. Some of the scripts had to be slightly modified to be added to the gui. some scripts were directly included in the gui but originated as seperate scripts for testing.

### Problems Faced
We faced a few problems during our first sprint. One of the problems we were facing was learning new libraries to use with python. For example, when creating the gui we needed to do research to figure out a library to do so. This meant we had to find a library and reserach the documentation and try to learn from examples. Another problem was being able to solve bugs that may have came up in someone else's code. This meant we would have to communicate and see what the other person's code was meant to do and why they might have went with that specific method. Another issue was going from the code we created to test each function and implementing them into a gui. Some of the scripts and functions had to be rewritten to work with the gui.
