# CMSC 355 Project - Warehouse Database

## Description
This is a warehouse storage program that lets a user search through a data base to find a specific item. We are currently working on the project and have plans on adding more user cases. So far we implemented the search and add use cases. In the subsections below we go into more detail about what we worked on and the requirements for each sprint.

### Testing

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Python Installed
- Tkinter Python Library

### Installing
- Check to make sure python is installed
- Download imported libraries if not already installed

### Executing Program
 - Run python code


# Workflow/Sprint Schedule (Requirements)
## Sprint 1 (due 3/28)

### Summary
The first sprint had us meet as a team to create a program and think about the different use cases we needed to implement. We were required to create 2 use cases as well as test cases to show that they work. We were required to hold team meetings to discuss how we wanted to split up the work. We decided to use a Gui design to help the program be much easier to use for non technical users.

### Problems Faced
We faced a few problems during our first sprint. One of the problems we were facing was learning new libraries to use with python. For example, when creating the gui we needed to do research to figure out a libarary to do so. This meant we had to find a library and reserach the documentation and try to learn from examples.
